MANDATORY
Compile
- [✅] Use "make -n" to see if compilation use "-Wall -Wextra -Werror". If not, select the "invalid compilation" flag.
- [✅] minishell compiles without any errors. If not, select the flag.
- [✅] The Makefile must not re-link. If not, select the flag.

Simple Command & global variables
- [✅] Execute a simple command with an absolute path like /bin/ls, or any other command without any options.
    1. Command: /bin/ls
        Expected: Lists current directory contents.
    2. Command: /bin/pwd
        Expected: Prints current working directory.
    3. Command: /bin/echo hello
        Expected: hello
- [✅] How many global variables are used? Why? Ask the evaluated student to give you a concrete example of why it feels mandatory or logical.
    1.✅ Action: Run minishell, press Ctrl+C
        Expected: Shell doesn't exit. Global variable (e.g., g_exit_status) updated with SIGINT code.
    2.✅ Action: Run a blocking command (e.g., cat) and send Ctrl+\
        Expected: Shell handles SIGQUIT. Global var reflects it if used.
    3.✅ Action: Check if variable affects exit status after signal
       Command: ./minishell → press Ctrl+C → type echo $?
        Expected: Returns 130 (signal exit code for SIGINT)
- [❌] Check the global variable. This global variable cannot provide any other information or data access than the number of a received signal.
    1.✅ Inspect: Is the global variable only storing the signal code?
        Expected: Variable (e.g., g_exit_status = 2) only represents SIGINT, not command data or status.
    2.❌ Action: Set global var manually in code to invalid value (e.g., g_exit_status = 999)
        Expected: Shell behaves incorrectly → proves it’s tied only to signal codes.
    3.✅ Action: Trigger SIGINT and observe how the shell reacts (e.g., resets prompt, doesn’t exit)
        Expected: Shell reads g_exit_status = SIGINT (2) only to decide prompt behavior, not for logic branching.
- [✅] Test an empty command.
    1.✅ Input: (Just press Enter)
        Expected: No output or error, just new prompt.
    2.✅ Input: "" (empty string in quotes)
        Expected:  : command not found.
    3.✅ Input: '' (same as above but with single quotes)
        Expected:  : command not found.
- [✅] Test only spaces or tabs.
    1.✅ Input: (5 spaces)
        Expected: No output, prompt returns.
    2.✅ Action: press tab 1 time
        Expected: No output.
    3.✅ Action: press tab 2 or more times
        Expected: ls of current dir.
- [✅] If something crashes, select the "crash" flag.
    1.✅ Input: unset PATH → then try: ls
        Expected: Should fail gracefully (e.g., "command not found"), not crash.
    2.✅ Input: export VERYLONG=$(yes | head -n 100000)
        Expected: Should handle large env vars without crashing.
    3.✅ Action: Pipe invalid memory (e.g., echo test | ./minishell) if supported
        Expected: Should handle input without segmentation fault.
- [✅] If something doesn't work, select the "incomplete work" flag.
    1.✅ Input: ls |
        Expected: Syntax error. If nothing happens or no error shown → incomplete.
    2.✅ Input: cd
        Expected: Should go to $HOME. If not → incomplete.
    3.✅ Input: echo hello >
        Expected: Syntax error. If shell hangs or does nothing → incomplete.

Arguments
- [✅] Execute a simple command with an absolute path like /bin/ls, or any other command with arguments but without any quotes or double quotes.

        Expected: Detailed list of all files, including hidden ones
    3.✅ Command: /bin/mkdir testdir
        Expected: Creates a new directory named testdir

    1.✅ Command: /bin/touch a b c
        Expected: /bin/touch: No such file or directory
    2.✅ Command: /bin/rm a b c
        Expected:   rm: a: No such file or directory
                    rm: b: No such file or directory
                    rm: c: No such file or directory
    3.✅ Command: /bin/echo 1 2 3 4 5
        Expected: 1 2 3 4 5
- [❔] If something crashes, select the "crash" flag.
    1.✅ Command: export TEST
        Expected: Crash — missing = in export should be handled gracefully, but some implementations crash if not validated properly.
    2.✅ Command: unset (with no arguments)
        Expected: Should be handled safely. Some implementations dereference null/invalid pointers → crash if no argument check.
