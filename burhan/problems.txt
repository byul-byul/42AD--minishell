1. prompt 'minishell$' is wasting with other messages during exploring history
2. Simple Command & global variables: - [❌] Test only spaces or tabs. ❌: tabs are not working
3. Ctrl+C after command 'grep something' does not show prompt messages.
4. echo $USER' --> not the same as in bash



5. ctrl+D shows exit on new line with prompt and then one more prompt on new line:
minishell$ 
minishell$ exit
minishell: %

it should show only exit on the same line

6. cat the ctrl+c shows two prompts:
minishell$ cat
^C
minishell$ 
minishell$ 

should show only one

7.
minishell$ echo $'USER'
bhajili
minishell$ echo $"USER"
bhajili


bash-3.2$ echo $'USER'
USER
bash-3.2$ echo $"USER"
USER
